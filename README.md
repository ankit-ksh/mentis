# Mentis

Mentis is a lightweight, minimalistic, and opinionated cross-platform (Linux, Mac, and Windows) self learning application designed to enhance the learning experience for anyone. It is built using [Qt for Python](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python). If you want to contribute, check out the [contributing guide](./contributing-guide.md). Below is a list of primary features (for an exhaustive list of planned features, check out the [long feature list](./docs/long-feature-list.md)):
